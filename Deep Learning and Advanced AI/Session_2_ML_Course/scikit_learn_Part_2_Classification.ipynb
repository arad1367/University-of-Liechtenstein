        "\n",
        "This notebook is **Part 2 - Classification**, and it is designed as a hands-on exercise for students. Your task is to follow the workflow demonstrated in **Part 1 - Regression** and apply it to a classification problem using scikit-learn.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Instructions:\n",
        "1. Replace the placeholders below with your group's details.\n",
        "2. Use a classification dataset from scikit-learn (e.g., `load_iris`, `load_digits`) or any other suitable dataset.\n",
        "3. Follow the same steps outlined in Part 1, adapting them for classification:\n",
        "   - Data preprocessing and EDA.\n",
        "   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.\n",
        "   - Training and evaluating classification models.\n",
        "   - Using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
        "   - Experimenting with hyperparameter tuning.\n",
        "4. Save the best model using `pickle` and deploy it with a simple Gradio app.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Group Details:\n",
        "- **Group Name**: [Insert Your Group Name Here]\n",
        "- **Members**:\n",
        "  - [Insert Member 1 Name]\n",
        "  - [Insert Member 2 Name]\n",
        "  - [Insert Member 3 Name]\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Dataset:\n",
        "- **Dataset Name**: [Insert Dataset Name Here]\n",
        "- **Problem Type**: Classification\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Models to Explore:\n",
        "- SVC\n",
        "- KNeighborsClassifier\n",
        "- Random Forest Classifier\n",
        "- (Optional) XGBoost or LightGBM for advanced exploration\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Deliverables:\n",
        "1. A completed Jupyter Notebook with all sections filled out.\n",
        "2. A brief report summarizing your findings, including:\n",
        "   - Model performance comparison.\n",
        "   - Insights from the classification task.\n",
        "3. A deployed Gradio app for real-time predictions.\n",
